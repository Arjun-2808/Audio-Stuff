Engineered and integrated a closed-loop audio amplifier system (THAT2180C VCA, LM380N PA, CA3140 VU Meter) on an STM32 + VScope platform, calibrating subsystem gains/offsets
and characterizing PA frequency response (100 Hz to 50 kHz), while developing MicroPython/Python (Jupyter Notebook, ipywidgets) firmware for real-time RMS feedback and
step-up/down volume stabilization.
